I am a postdoctoral researcher at [PreMeDICal](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) which is a joint team between Inria and Inserm in Montpellier since October 2025, advised by [Aur√©lien Bellet](https://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/). I am working with him on personalized federated learning for high dimensional data.

I did in 2024-2025 a postdoc at Alexander Grothendieck Montpellier Institute (IMAG) of the university of Montpellier and in [IROKO](https://inria.fr/fr/iroko) team of Inria with [Joseph Salmon](https://josephsalmon.eu/) and [Mohamed Hebiri](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/hebiri.mohamed/). I worked with them on uncertainty quantification with the scope on conformal prediction, in particular motivated by ecological questions and by [Pl@ntNet](https://plantnet.org/), a citizen science plant recognition application developed by IROKO team.

In October 2024, I have defended my Phd at the University Paris-Saclay that I have done under the supervision of [Gilles Blanchard](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~gilles.blanchard/) and [Magalie Fromont](https://perso.univ-rennes2.fr/magalie.fromont).
